## MILESTONES
For each week, milestones were created using GitHub's project <i>kanban</i> such that each person in the team will select on a issue to work on.
<br/>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cross-country-coders/cross-country-coders/projects/1">Milestone 1</a></li>
For Milestone 1, the mock up design for the application was made and after that each person using Meteor, Javascript, and React created the application. Additionally, we also talked about the security features of the application itself.
